    "text": "In the fantastical realm of Terra, a mesmerizing astral system casts its celestial spell upon the lands below. At the center of this cosmic dance reigns the radiant and mighty Sun, fondly addressed by the denizens of this world as Loki. Surrounding Loki are three enigmatic Moons, named Ran, Jord, and Njord, each weaving its mystical influence across the planet.\nLoki, the golden orb of brilliance, becomes the focal point of the heavens, its majestic orbit defining the ebb and flow of days. Ingenious civilizations have embraced the concept of hours, skillfully partitioning the day into 24 equal segments. Yet, in the farthest reaches of Terra, there are enigmatic cultures that prefer not the burden of counting moments, opting to embrace the passage of time with an air of timeless grace.\nRan, the Moon of tides and mysteries, traces a mesmerizing path through the firmament, its celestial journey marking the arrival and departure of the year. A year in Terra spans an enchanting 400 days, a vast cycle that echoes Ran’s clockwise orbit from the northern Frostlands. Those blessed to dwell in the regions closest to this enigmatic lunar orb experience a realm of ethereal beauty and magical frost, for it is during this wondrous season, known as Winter, when the lands are adorned in glistening ice and blanketed in the softest of snowfalls.\nJord, the Moon of tremors and upheaval, embarks on an intriguing voyage that spans four years, marking its presence with geophysical events that stir the very foundation of Terra. When Jord graces the night sky with its enigmatic glow, the land trembles beneath its cosmic influence, and the earth itself seems to voice its emotions through earthquakes that ripple across the landscape like echoes of ancient legends.\nNjord, the tempestuous Moon of storms and hurricanes, boasts a mystifying orbit lasting three years. When Njord claims its rightful place amidst the skies, the elements dance with wild abandon. Mighty storms rage across the lands, and hurricanes unleash their fury upon the shores, creating a breathtaking display of elemental power that both terrifies and captivates the hearts of those who witness it.",

    "text": "Origins\nΙn the realm where the boundary between life and death blurs, there exists a chilling phenomenon—a group of humans who have defied mortality itself. By striking dark bargains, they have exchanged their souls for eternal existence, transcending the confines of the living and transforming into the undead. These once-human entities, now reduced to mere skeletal figures, wander the world as embodiments of eerie tales.\nThe undead, bound to an existence of perpetual darkness, stand as a testament to the consequences of seeking immortality at any cost. They serve as reminders of the precarious line between life and death, their haunting presence a reflection of the choices made in desperation. Their eternal journey carries them through abandoned domains, forever separated from the living.\n\n\nPhysical Form\nThe undead, resembling living skeletons, bear a haunting appearance that strikes fear into the hearts of those who catch a glimpse. Though their size remains human, their bodies become emaciated, their forms reduced to a skeletal state. These remnants of their former selves stand as spectral reminders of the eternal torment they have chosen.\n\n\nSociety\nFar from the prying eyes of the living, the undead navigate a path veiled in shadows, their terrifying nature ensuring their exclusion from human societies. They are drawn to abandoned structures, be they decrepit castles, dilapidated farms, or foreboding dungeons, seeking solace in these desolate realms away from the living. Given their chilling nature, the undead instinctively avoid human settlements. Rarely welcomed among the living, they lurk in the shadows, wary of the fear and revulsion they evoke.\nTheir existence is often relegated to the realm of horror stories, their presence stirring unease and trepidation. Instead, they find comfort in the solitude of forsaken places, where they can dwell undisturbed, far from the watchful eyes of the living. Should the need arise, the undead may reluctantly interact with the living. However, they cloak themselves in full clothing or armor, obscuring their skeletal visage from prying eyes. The true face of an undead remains a mystery, concealed behind layers of fabric and protection. No man, elf, or dwarf has ever beheld the stark countenance of an undead, as their lack of breathing and skeletal form betray their inhuman nature.\n\n\nCombat Style\nIn battle, the undead favor swords and shields as their weapons of choice. Their skeletal forms possess an eerie grace as they wield their blades with precision and efficiency. Shields become an extension of their spectral defense, aiding them in warding off attacks. Furthermore, their undeath grants them a resistance against piercing assaults, including arrows that would typically find their mark. The resilience of their spectral existence affords them an advantage in the face of such threats.\n\n\nStats\nUndead begin with the following ability points at level 0:\n\n30 Vitality\n10 Sanity\n+2 Strength\n+2 Dexterity\n+2 Intelligence\n+0 Willpower\n\n\n\nSpecial Abilities\nDarkvision: Undead have darkvision. In contrast with popular superstitions, they do not have light sensitivity.\nFrightful Presence: Undead are haunting in sight. They gain advantage to impose fear effects on their targets.\nNeeds Needn’t: The undead don’t need to ingest food or water. They don’t become starved or parched. They do not breathe. They are immune to nauseating effects.\nOld Ones: Undead were there when history was written. They gain +3 Profession points, in the scholar profession.\nMental Suffering: Undead are constantly crushed by the weight of their existence, reliving their death a million times over. They have vulnerability against the spirit element.\nSticks n Stones: Undead gain resistance against piercing attacks (including arrows).",

    "text": "Origins\nIn rare and extraordinary circumstances, when humans teeter on the precipice of death, the whimsical deities of the Fey Realm may be moved by their plight and bestow upon them a second chance at life. These fortunate souls, touched by the divine grace of the Fey, undergo a wondrous transformation, merging their essence with that of the animals that roam the Fey Realm. Thus, the fey-touched creatures come into existence, embodying a harmonious blend of human and animal traits.\n\n\nPhysical Form\nThese extraordinary beings bear the marks of their benefactor deity, their very nature infused with the essence of a specific type of animal from the realm of the Fey. Such a metamorphosis gifts them with a unique array of animalistic characteristics, both physical and mystical, that distinguish them from their purely human counterparts. The animal characteristics may be subtle or more extensive, usually covering the fatal wounds suffered prior to the transition. The lifespan of fey-touched creatures is similar to humans, sometimes proloung or shortened based on the animal traits granted.\n\n\nSociety\nUnlike other races that tend to form distinct societies, the fey-touched creatures chart a different path. Rather than establishing their own communities, they often choose to wander the vast expanses of the world, their hearts yearning for freedom and exploration. Some choose to embrace their prime nature, living in the wild. Others find solace in the bustling human settlements, skillfully blending into the tapestry of society, their animal traits concealed beneath a veil of normalcy. It is amidst the hustle and bustle of humanity that these extraordinary beings find purpose, their dual nature serving as a bridge between the mortal realm and the enchanting realm of the Fey.\n\n\nCombat Style\nFrom the elegant sweep of a sword to the swift release of an arrow, fey-touched humans harness their natural grace and agility to master the art of weaponry. However, it is not just conventional arms that they possess, for their divine transformation also bestows upon them an arsenal of their own claws that shimmer with mystical energy and teeth that gleam like shards of moonlight. In their newfound form, fey-touched beings have the option to embrace their innate animalistic attributes. Many of these extraordinary creatures, choosing to forego conventional armor, rely instead on the resilience of their natural hide. Their flesh becomes a protective barrier, toughened by the mystical energies coursing through their veins. Whether they possess a leonine mane that shields them from harm or a sleek coat that seems impervious to blades, their primal defense allows them to navigate the world unencumbered by the weight of armor.\n\n\nStats\nFey-touched begin with the following ability points at level 0:\n\n20 Vitality\n10 Sanity\n+2 Strength\n+1 Dexterity\n+2 Intelligence\n+2 Willpower\n\nFey-touched creatures get to reallocate 2 points, justified by the animal aspect they gain.\n\n\nSpecial Abilities\nAnimal Traits: Fey-touched creatures usually have claws, see in the dark or sniff out their prey far better than a common Human. They can choose two of the following characteristics that their animal form possesses.\n\nClaws: You You gain a claw attack The damage is determined in section Equipment, subsection Weapons.\nTeeth: You gain a bite attack. The damage is determined in section Equipment, subsection Weapons.\nHorns: You gain a horn attack. The damage is determined in section Equipment, subsection Weapons.\nHooves: You gain a kick attack. The damage is determined in section Equipment, subsection Weapons.\nSlam: You gain a gore attack. The damage is determined in section Equipment, subsection Weapons.\nHide: You gain natural armor +2.\nFast: You gain +2 movement speed.\nClimber: You can climb at normal speed.\nSwimmer: You can swim at normal speed.\nNocturnal: You gain darkvision.\nHunter: You gain advantage on Perception checks.\n\nAnimal Form: Fey-touched can transform into their animal aspect at will. While in animal form, they use the physical abilities (Vitality, Strength, Dexterity) of the beast and the mental abilities of their own (Sanity, Intelligence, Willpower). They cannot speak, but they can understand the languages they normally do. They can communicate simple concepts with their kin.\nAnimal Senses: Fey-touched creatures have a keen sense of hearing and smell, gaining a +5 bonus to relevant perception checks.\nFey Vulnerability: Fey-touched, like most fey creatures, have vulnerability against cold iron.",

    "text": "Origins\nThere are those among the ranks of humanity who, driven by a thirst for power and liberation, willingly delve into the depths of darkness. They form pacts and sign contracts with otherworldly beings, entities that promise them untold power and freedom. These cursed beings, shunned by human society, are known as Demonspawn.\n\n\nPhysical Form\nTowering above their mortal counterparts, they stand as large-sized creatures, their forms reaching heights of up to 2.2 meters and weighing a formidable 120 kilograms. The appearance of Demonspawn is as terrifying as their dark origins. Horns, like twisted talons, protrude from their heads, marking them as creatures of sinister lineage. Some may possess sharp claws, honed for rending flesh, while others bear wings that evoke a haunting beauty. Their lifespan, shrouded in mystery, is unknown, leaving open the possibility that they may possess a form of immortality, forever cursed to tread the realms of the living.\n\n\nSociety\nThese physical manifestations of their infernal heritage serve as a testament to the depths they have delved into, forever marking them as outcasts from human and other societies. Forced to walk a solitary path, Demonspawn live lives cloaked in darkness. Cast out from the light of acceptance, they navigate a world that fears and despises their very existence. Solitude becomes their constant companion as they wander the fringes of society, ever mindful of the darkness that courses through their veins.\n\n\nCombat Style\nMagic becomes the lifeblood of the Demonspawn, their abilities rooted in the arcane arts. They draw upon the forbidden and sinister forces that lie beyond mortal comprehension, harnessing magic as their primary means of power. However, these cursed beings are not limited to magic alone, for they possess the freedom to choose any weapon that aligns with their desires. Whether it be a wickedly curved blade, a staff pulsating with dark energy, or a bow whispered with curses, the Demonspawn can wield an array of weapons with lethal proficiency. While some Demonspawn find armor unnecessary, preferring the freedom of unencumbered movement, they possess the ability to utilize any type of protective gear. When the need arises, they can don armor of various materials, from hardened steel to enchanted warding plates.\nThough their physical resilience may be formidable on its own, the wise among them understand the value of additional protection, should they find themselves facing formidable adversaries. The path of Demonspawn is one fraught with darkness and isolation. They tread a perilous line between mortal and otherworldly, their souls forever marked by the pacts they have made. Each Demonspawn is a testament to the price one is willing to pay for power, their existence a haunting reminder of the consequences that accompany the pursuit of forbidden knowledge and otherworldly bargains.\n\n\nStats\nDemonspawn begin with the following ability points at level 0:\n\n20 Vitality\n20 Sanity\n+2 Strength\n+1 Dexterity\n+1 Intelligence\n+2 Willpower\n\n\n\nSpecial Abilities\nDark Aura: Demonspawn emit a dark aura around them. They gain advantage on stealth checks made in the dark.\nDarkvision: Demonspawn have darkvision and light sensitivity.\nDemonic Resistances: Demonspawn are particularly resistant to elemental magic. They have resistance against 3 of the following elements: earth, fire, water, and wind. They have vulnerability against the light.\nBlood Magic: Demonspawn have the ability to use their own blood as fuel for their incantations. Once per day, they can sacrifice a portion of their vitality to cast a spell. The points lost are equal to double the spell’s tier. The spell may be from the complete spell list and does not have to be a known one. It cannot belong to the Light element, and it cannot be of a tier higher than the character’s Intelligence score.\nSilver Tongue: Demonspawn gain two extra profession points, one in chronicler and one in lawyer.\nNatural Armor: Demonspawn have hard skin, gaining a +1 natural armor bonus.",

    "text": "Greenkin\nIn the sprawling expanse of the realms, the Green Kin stands as a formidable and unique family. Within this eclectic lineage, one finds Orcs, Trolls, and their pint-sized counterparts, the Goblins. Though they share a common ancestry with the graceful and ethereal Fey, their existence paints a canvas distinct from that of their Elven kin. These beings possess a peculiar nature that sets them apart, characterized by a constant tension with other races and, more often than not, even among themselves. The origins of the Green Kin trace back to the ancient Fey, who were born from the heart of magnificent trees, imbued with the essence of nature itself. Over time, however, the line diverged, and these descendants adopted an entirely different path. Unlike their Elven cousins, who embraced harmony with the land, the Green Folk have come to be known for their unruly and often chaotic existence. One of the most striking aspects of the Green Kin’s way of life is their unrefined and primal behavior. They eat and sleep much like humans, yet with notable deviations. Their culinary preferences lean heavily toward raw meat, relishing in the visceral thrill of tearing into freshly hunted prey. Cooking is a rare endeavor for them, a practice only indulged in on the rarest of occasions. The scent of searing meat over a campfire is foreign to their senses, as they prefer the raw, unadulterated essence of their prey. Observing the Green Kin in their daily routines can be an unsettling experience for those unfamiliar with their ways. Each of the three races within the family exhibits a profound connection to their primal instincts. Orcs, with their robust physiques and powerful frames, are often likened to savage warriors. Trolls, towering and hulking, display a near-insatiable appetite for destruction and chaos. Goblins, though diminutive in stature, possess an innate cunning and mischievousness that makes them both dangerous and unpredictable. Conflict simmers beneath the surface of the Green Kin’s interactions, both with outsiders and among themselves. Their society is a volatile mixture of rivalries, territorial disputes, and power struggles, where alliances are fleeting and betrayal is commonplace. It is a world where might makes right, and survival is a constant struggle. Despite their savage tendencies and propensity for discord, the Green Kin are a vital part of the fantasy world’s rich tapestry. Their presence adds depth and complexity to the realms they inhabit, as they navigate the fine line between their primal origins and the evolving world around them, forever bound to the green and untamed heart of their ancestry. Orcs Orcs emerge as formidable and enigmatic beings, their existence shrouded in the bleak shadows of forsaken lands. They are creatures deeply tied to the untamed wilderness, fiercely guarding their territories from all intruders, especially the Toons who dare approach their revered mother tree. Standing imposingly at heights ranging from 2 to 2.5 meters and weighing over 150 kilograms, Orcs are a force to be reckoned with. Within the Orcish society, two distinct categories emerge: the tribal Orcs of the Swamps and the nomadic Orcs of Erämaa. These two factions, despite their differences, share a common ferocity and determination, embodying the essence of the Orcish spirit. It is a somber truth that Orcs are often met with distrust and fear from most other races. Amongst Humans, they are frequently ostracized, forced to navigate the lowest echelons of society, their potential unrealized. For Elves, Orcs are perceived as a blight, a creeping disease that withers the very nature around them, and as such, Elves rarely tolerate their presence. Even the most fearsome of Fey beasts harbor a natural hostility toward Orcs, with the exception of the children of Felis and Ha’até, who inexplicably extend their rarest of welcomes. In the realm of combat, Orcs are renowned for their affinity for great, two-handed weapons, with a distinct preference for massive axes that can cleave through foes with brutal efficiency. Occasionally, they wield formidable swords, showcasing their versatility in battle. Yet, Orcs are no strangers to ranged combat, always carrying heavy spears for throwing, ensuring that no enemy remains beyond their reach. Their choice of attire often leans towards practicality, with a preference for leather armor over the cumbersome metallic alternatives. This adaptability allows Orcs to move with agility and strike with precision, making them a truly relentless force on the battlefield. Stats Orcs begin with the following ability points at level 0:  30 Vitality  +4 Strength  +0 Dexterity  20 Sanity  +0 Intelligence  +3 Willpower Special Abilities Spiritvision: Orcs can see all spirits around them. This causes blindness when they are around a large number of souls, particularly humans.\nNatural Armor: Orcs have particularly hard skin, gaining a +2 Armor bonus. Fearless: Orcs are immune to all fear effects. Nethergrasp: Orcs can grasp spirits and ethereal beings as if they had physical substance. They can attack toons with their bare hands and have resistance against spirit damage. Tribes: Orcs belong to one of two tribes:  Swamp Orcs: There is no better home for Toons than the marshlands, vast lands that the sun can hardly reach. Some say that those swamps remind them of their very own realm. Swamp Orcs live in tribes deep inside the marshlands. They are born from Salix trees, which grow in muddy waters. Legends say these Orcs can live for up to a millennium; most of them die in battle far earlier than that though.  Desert Orcs: Sand keeps its secrets well. In its hidden catacombs Toons lurk until the sun goes out. The nomadic Orcs of Erämaa and Percia are always on the Hunt. They are born from Acacia trees. The Desert Orcs have a lifespan of 200 years. Trolls In the dark corners of the world where the shadows grow long and the land turns unforgiving, there dwell the Trolls. These formidable creatures are the embodiment of wrath, their existence marred by violence and bloodshed. Trolls, shunned by the world’s other races, live on the fringes, engulfed in their own anger. Trolls come in two distinct breeds, each unique in their own right. First, there are the Trolls of the Swamps, solitary giants who navigate the murky waters of their isolated homes. Second, the tribal Trolls of the Jungle, who band together in fearsome clans, united by their shared rage. Both breeds share a common feature; a burning, uncontrollable anger that defines their very essence. Standing at a towering 3 to 4 meters in height and weighing a staggering 250 kilograms, Trolls are imposing figures on the landscape. Their lifespans remain a mystery, primarily because they are more likely to meet their end at the hands of their own kind rather than succumb to natural causes. Trolls are not creatures that find acceptance among other races. Humans, often quick to judge, attack Trolls on sight, labeling them as mindless monsters. Dwarves, with their pragmatic view of the world, consider Trolls irrelevant and steer clear of them. Elves, known for their grace and beauty, find Trolls nothing short of repulsive, their appearance and behavior a stark contrast to Elvish ideals. Trolls are not known for their finesse or craftsmanship; instead, they wield large clubs or logs, primarily as weapons but also as excellent back scratchers. They rarely adorn themselves with armor, but when they do, it’s often the hide of their victims, potentially even those of their human prey. Stats Trolls begin with the following ability points at level 0:  40 Vitality  +5 Strength  +0 Dexterity  20 Sanity  +0 Intelligence  +1 Willpower Special Abilities Regeneration: Trolls have regenerative abilities, healing 5 life points per round. Trolls wounded for more than half their life points have their regeneration lowered to 1 life point per round. Fire suppresses regeneration for one round. Natural Armor: Trolls have particularly hard skin, gaining a +2 Armor bonus. Swamp Trolls: Trolls that live in the swamps lead solitary lives. They are born from Ash trees, which grow in muddy waters. Their lifespan is 350 years. Swamp Trolls are filthy and cannot hide the intense smell of fungi that covers them. They get:  Marsh Strider: They can walk in muddy waters without any problem.  Light Sensitivity: They are blinded by intense light.  Poisonous Skin: Creatures that touch them risk being poisoned.\nJungle Trolls: Jungle Trolls live in tribes. They are born from kapok trees and have a lifespan of 60 years. They are territorial and have short tempers. Jungle Trolls get:  Member of the Tribe: They get a +3 Talisman bonus when in groups.  Animal Senses: They get a +5 Perception bonus. Goblins In a shadowy world, Goblins are renowned for their cunning and devious nature. These mischievous creatures possess a knack for acquiring things without spending a single coin, believing that if you can steal it, why waste hard-earned treasure? This philosophy defines their way of life, though it often leads to them being hunted down mercilessly by Humans who view them with deep-seated distrust and fear, resorting to violence at the mere sight of a Goblin. Goblins stand diminutively, reaching a modest height of 50 to 80 centimeters and weighing around 20 kilograms. Their short stature allows them to navigate hidden nooks and crannies with ease, perfect for their thieving endeavors. Unfortunately, their small size also shortens their lifespan, with most Goblins living only 30 years. These crafty beings seldom operate alone, preferring to band together in tight-knit gangs ranging from 5 to 20 individuals. Within these groups, two key figures emerge as leaders: the Chieftain and the Shaman. The Chieftain is typically the tallest Goblin in the gang, chosen for their imposing stature and natural leadership skills. They play a vital role in decision-making and representing the gang’s interests. The Shaman, on the other hand, possesses a unique and coveted talent – the ability to create fire. This extraordinary power sets them apart, earning both respect and fear from their fellow Goblins. Shamans are known to live significantly longer than their peers, with some reaching the ripe age of 50 years. Their mastery of fire-making is essential for survival, aiding in cooking stolen food and providing warmth during the chill of night. When it comes to their habitats, Goblins prefer to make their homes in the most unlikely of places – abandoned neighborhoods and slums. These forgotten corners of the world offer them refuge from prying eyes and often supply a plethora of hidden treasures to pilfer. As resourceful beings, Goblins fashion their weapons from scrap materials scavenged during their nocturnal forays. Small blades and slings are their preferred tools of the trade, ideal for quick and silent strikes. Their ingenuity extends to their choice of armor, favoring the durability and affordability of leather. Interestingly, Goblins have a particular fondness for smelly leather, believing that the stench adds an intimidating aura to their presence. Stats Goblins begin with the following ability points at level 0:  10 Vitality  +1 Strength  +4 Dexterity  20 Sanity  +3 Intelligence  +1 Willpower Special Abilities Filthy yet Healthy: Goblins have immunity against nauseating effects. Born Acrobats: Even though they are small, goblins are extremely dexterous. They can walk on narrow surfaces without a problem and jump 2m high. Sticky Fingers: Goblins can’t resist a shiny trinket. They get a +3 Stealth bonus. Talented: Goblins practice many different arts. They gain +2 Profession points, one of them in the Engineer profession. Ankle Biter: When attacked bare-handed Goblins, as a reaction, bite down on the offending limb, giving them 2d4 piercing damage.",

Trolls are not known for their finesse or craftsmanship; instead, they wield large clubs or logs, primarily as weapons but also as excellent back scratchers. They rarely adorn themselves with armor, but when they do, it’s often the hide of their victims, potentially even those of their human prey. Stats Trolls begin with the following ability points at level 0:  40 Vitality  +5 Strength  +0 Dexterity  20 Sanity  +0 Intelligence  +1 Willpower Special Abilities Regeneration: Trolls have regenerative abilities, healing 5 life points per round. Trolls wounded for more than half their life points have their regeneration lowered to 1 life point per round. Fire suppresses regeneration for one round. Natural Armor: Trolls have particularly hard skin, gaining a +2 Armor bonus. Swamp Trolls: Trolls that live in the swamps lead solitary lives. They are born from Ash trees, which grow in muddy waters. Their lifespan is 350 years. Swamp Trolls are filthy and cannot hide the intense smell of fungi that covers them. They get:  Marsh Strider: They can walk in muddy waters without any problem.  Light Sensitivity: They are blinded by intense light.  Poisonous Skin: Creatures that touch them risk being poisoned.\nJungle Trolls: Jungle Trolls live in tribes. They are born from kapok trees and have a lifespan of 60 years. They are territorial and have short tempers. Jungle Trolls get:  Member of the Tribe: They get a +3 Talisman bonus when in groups.  Animal Senses: They get a +5 Perception bonus. Goblins In a shadowy world, Goblins are renowned for their cunning and devious nature. These mischievous creatures possess a knack for acquiring things without spending a single coin, believing that if you can steal it, why waste hard-earned treasure? This philosophy defines their way of life, though it often leads to them being hunted down mercilessly by Humans who view them with deep-seated distrust and fear, resorting to violence at the mere sight of a Goblin. Goblins stand diminutively, reaching a modest height of 50 to 80 centimeters and weighing around 20 kilograms. Their short stature allows them to navigate hidden nooks and crannies with ease, perfect for their thieving endeavors. Unfortunately, their small size also shortens their lifespan, with most Goblins living only 30 years. These crafty beings seldom operate alone, preferring to band together in tight-knit gangs ranging from 5 to 20 individuals. Within these groups, two key figures emerge as leaders: the Chieftain and the Shaman. The Chieftain is typically the tallest Goblin in the gang, chosen for their imposing stature and natural leadership skills. They play a vital role in decision-making and representing the gang’s interests. The Shaman, on the other hand, possesses a unique and coveted talent – the ability to create fire. This extraordinary power sets them apart, earning both respect and fear from their fellow Goblins. Shamans are known to live significantly longer than their peers, with some reaching the ripe age of 50 years. Their mastery of fire-making is essential for survival, aiding in cooking stolen food and providing warmth during the chill of night. When it comes to their habitats, Goblins prefer to make their homes in the most unlikely of places – abandoned neighborhoods and slums. These forgotten corners of the world offer them refuge from prying eyes and often supply a plethora of hidden treasures to pilfer. As resourceful beings, Goblins fashion their weapons from scrap materials scavenged during their nocturnal forays. Small blades and slings are their preferred tools of the trade, ideal for quick and silent strikes. Their ingenuity extends to their choice of armor, favoring the durability and affordability of leather. Interestingly, Goblins have a particular fondness for smelly leather, believing that the stench adds an intimidating aura to their presence. Stats Goblins begin with the following ability points at level 0:  10 Vitality  +1 Strength  +4 Dexterity  20 Sanity  +3 Intelligence  +1 Willpower Special Abilities Filthy yet Healthy: Goblins have immunity against nauseating effects. Born Acrobats: Even though they are small, goblins are extremely dexterous. They can walk on narrow surfaces without a problem and jump 2m high. Sticky Fingers: Goblins can’t resist a shiny trinket. They get a +3 Stealth bonus. Talented: Goblins practice many different arts. They gain +2 Profession points, one of them in the Engineer profession. Ankle Biter: When attacked bare-handed Goblins, as a reaction, bite down on the offending limb, giving them 2d4 piercing damage.",

To become a nox, a sylvan elf must attend the Rite of the Frozen Legion, drowning in a frozen lake under the night sky, infused with undead blood. This metamorphosis turns them into creatures of ice and darkness. They are nox, the Drowned Ones.\n\n\nPhysical Form\nNox retain most of their elven physical characteristics. Their skin turns greyish-black, their eyes shine from red to purple and then to pitch black depending on their temper. Their lifespan is said to increase to 500 years, but most of them die in battle way before they reach older age.\n\n\nSociety\nNox lead solitary lives. They can be found in human cities, clocking travelers from the top of a watchtower or the corner of a tavern.

    "text": "Origins\nIn the vast and ancient realm of Terra, one can find a unique and enigmatic race known as Dwarves. These beings are unlike any other inhabitants of this mystical world, for they are not merely born into existence as others are, but rather, they are the very offspring of Terra itself. In stark contrast to the societies of Elves or the familiar human families, Dwarves know not the concept of gender. They exist as a singular, undivided people, sculpted by the hand of their ancestors, unburdened by the intricate complexities of human reproduction.\nWhile they do not require sustenance, Dwarves occasionally indulge in the consumption of food and ale, though their culinary preferences lean towards the unadorned and the robust - roots, wafers, and hearty ales. They retire to rest for a duration of eight hours, much like their human counterparts, yet once slumber claims a Dwarf, they are said to sleep as soundly as the rocks that surround them. Attempting to rouse a sleeping Dwarf is not for the faint of heart, for it often requires a measure of force, and be forewarned, they respond to such disturbances with a vigorous retaliation.\nAmidst the scorching sands of the vast desert of Percia, a remarkable clan of Dwarves known as the Percians, or “desert” Dwarves, have established their unique existence. These Dwarves stand apart from their brethren not only in their arid homeland but also in their towering stature.\n\n\nPhysical Form\nTowering at heights ranging from 1.2 to 1.5 meters and possessing a robust frame weighing approximately 140 kilograms, they are indeed the tallest among the Dwarven kin.\n\n\nSociety\nA harsh and unforgiving environment has shaped the lives of the Percians, compelling most to pursue trades as smiths or merchants. Some among them serve the local authorities as guards, for in the treacherous expanse of the desert, safety is a rare commodity. The governance of sand towns falls under the purview of the governor, who is deemed by the law to be the ultimate authority. Yet, coin holds its own dominion in the heart of the desert, and merchant unions wield the true power. A relentless race for dominance unfurls among merchants and caravan leaders, where military attacks upon rivals are not uncommon. For the right price, a Percian is willing to undertake almost any endeavor, even if it means treachery.\nThe Percians revere fire as a deity, and those who can withstand its searing embrace earn the utmost respect within their society. This affinity for the element may explain their fondness for the Exsul and their graceful sword dancing. Percians have little regard for nobility and are primarily driven by a thirst for riches. As such, they often struggle to extend the proper respect toward Exsul and Human nobles, who view the Percians as uncultured brutes. However, this stereotype is not entirely accurate. Alongside the Gnomes, the Percians harbor a deep appreciation for written history, and books hold a special place in their bustling markets.\n\n\nCombat Style\nIn matters of combat, the Percians favor ranged warfare, displaying particular proficiency with javelins, nets, and daggers. For close-quarters battles, they favor swords, chains, and flails. Versatility characterizes their approach to armor, as they are known to don various types to suit the demands of their diverse endeavors. Shields often accompany them into battle, serving as a steadfast guardian against the myriad threats that dwell within their scorching desert domain. The Percians are a testament to the adaptability and resilience of the Dwarven race, thriving in an environment where only they could endure, and forging a culture that blends commerce, martial prowess, and a fiery reverence for their desert homeland.\n\n\nStats\nPercians begin with the following ability points at level 0:\n\n20 Vitality\n10 Sanity\n+2 Strength\n+1 Dexterity\n+2 Intelligence\n+2 Willpower\n\n\n\nSpecial Abilities\nDesert Folk: Percians have resistance to burning damage.\nImmovable: Percians cannot be tripped or pushed by creatures or objects less than twice their size. They are not encumbered.\nMerchants: Percians practice many different arts. They gain +2 Profession points.",

Attempting to rouse a sleeping Dwarf is not for the faint of heart, for it often requires a measure of force, and be forewarned, they respond to such disturbances with a vigorous retaliation.\nIn the frigid expanses of Terra’s northeastern coasts, a unique and formidable breed of Dwarves known as the Jötnar, or “frost” Dwarves, carve out their existence in a world unlike any other in the Dwarven kin. What sets them apart is not only their geography but also the very substance from which they are crafted. Unlike their earth-born brethren, the Jötnar are forged from water itself, a testament to the diversity of Terra’s creations.\n\n\nPhysical Form\nStanding at a height of 1.2 to 1.4 meters and weighing approximately 70 kilograms, the Jötnar possess a physicality distinct from other Dwarves. Their lifespan is comparatively shorter, spanning around 150 years, yet their existence is marked by an unyielding and warlike spirit.\n\n\nSociety\nJötnar societies are organized into small villages, led by chieftains who rise to power through sheer strength and prowess in battle. War is not merely a facet of Jötnar life; it is their way of life. They thrive on plundering coastal villages, raiding merchant ships, and confronting formidable foes such as sea serpents and strongholds. Nestled along the unforgiving northeastern coasts, their settlements are built in places where only the most formidable of creatures can endure. Jötnar have little room for emotions beyond one: honor. The concept of legacy is paramount to them, the tales and songs that will echo through the generations about the mighty warriors who single-handedly bested sea beasts and conquered human castles. They harbor no friendships or alliances with other races, often regarding humans with disdain, finding amusement in their timidity before chasing them to their fates with laughter. Yet, it is an unexpected paradox that Jötnar are known for their extraordinary singing abilities. Songs hold a sacred place in their society, serving as a conduit for preserving their history since they have no written records. After each plundering expedition, Jötnar warriors gather for feasts, consuming cured fish and raising their voices under the starry night sky.\n\n\nCombat Style\nIn battle, Jötnar wield an array of weapons, including longswords, axes, picks, pickaxes, tridents, hammers, maces, clubs, and slings. Anything less brutal does not satisfy their ferocious tastes. They shun heavy armor and shields, considering such protections as beneath their fierce and unyielding nature. In the world of the Jötnar, might makes right, and the legacy of ruthless warriors is etched into the icy annals of Terra’s history.\n\n\nStats\nJötnar begin with the following ability points at level 0:\n\n30 Vitality\n20 Sanity\n+3 Strength\n+1 Dexterity\n+0 Intelligence\n+1 Willpower\n\n\n\nSpecial Abilities\nSubterrans: Jötnar have resistance to frost damage.\nBarbaric Nature: Jötnar can stay conscious for one extra round before fainting.\nChildren of the Sea: Jötnar are born with one of the following special abilities:\n\nSeaform: Some Jötnar are excellent swimmers and can stay underwater without breathing.\nIce Spear: Some Jötnar can cover their arms in ice, turning them into lethal spears.\nSea Mending: Some Jötnar can coat slashing wounds with ice, gaining resistance.",

It is important for characters that thrive in teamwork, especially for those that want to lead and encourage their companions.\n\n\nTalents\nAn ability point assigned to strength, dexterity, intelligence, or willpower grants a new combat talent to the creature.

    "text": "Combat Round\nCombat revolves around two or more creatures standing off using a turn-based system. Each round represents 6 seconds in the game world; there are 10 rounds in a minute of combat. A round normally allows each character involved in a combat to act. Each round in its turn, a creature uses its abilities as a pool of energy in order to perform a number of skills. The combat flow is summarized in the following ordered list:\n\nSurprise round in case combat begins unexpectedly.\nAll combatants roll initiative.\nCombatants act in initiative order.\nWhen everyone has had a turn, the next round begins with the combatant with the highest initiative, until combat ends.\n\n\n\nSurprise Round\nCombat may spark unexpectedly. In that case, the single action that triggers combat initiative (e.g. a backstab or an explosion) is resolved before the combat begins. For example, a group of rogues may infiltrate the royal guard disguised as knights. Responding to their leader’s signal, all rogues stab the royal member they are supposed to protect. These single attacks compose the surprise round. Right after damage is dealt, all combatants roll initiative, and the combat begins.\n\n\nInitiative\nInitiative determines the order in which players and creatures act during a combat encounter. At the beginning of each battle, every participant, be it player characters or foes, must roll 1d10 and add their Dexterity to determine their place in the initiative sequence. The higher the roll, the earlier the participant gets to act. Once the initiative order is established, actions and abilities are resolved in sequence, starting from the highest roll and descending to the lowest. This ensures that each player has a chance to strategically plan their moves and react to the ever-changing battlefield dynamics. Quick-thinking and tactical decision-making become vital as the initiative roll sets the tempo for the entire combat encounter.\nA creature can choose to postpone its action, lowering its score in the initiative order. For the remainder of the battle, this is its new score; it cannot go back to the initial roll.",

    "text": "Skill Categories\nCombat skills are divided into four categories, depending on the ability they draw upon. Skills from the same or different categories may be combined to create powerful blows.\n\nFeats are powerful skills that draw upon strength, causing heavy wounds on the targets.\nManeuvers utilize dexterity in order to wear the opponent down.\nSpells are manifestations of elemental magic, driven by one’s intelligence.\nEvocations rely on sere willpower to unlock the true potential hidden within.\n\n\n\nSkill Range\nCombat skills and weapons have a specific range of effect.\n\nTouch: 1m.\nClose: 2m.\nShort: 5m.\nMedium: 10m.\nLong: 20m.\nDistant: 50m.\n\n\n\nDamage Type\nThere are several types of damage, and creatures may be resistant or vulnerable against one or more damage types.\n\nBludgeoning, caused by weapons such as hammers and clubs or certain spells, mainly geomancer ones.\nPiercing, caused by weapons such as knives and arrows.\nSlashing, caused by weapons such as swords and axes or certain spells, mainly aerotheurge ones.\nBurning, caused by high temperatures, fire, or certain spells, mainly pyrokinetic ones.\nFrost, caused by low temperatures, ice or certain spells, mainly hydrosophist ones.\nRadiant, caused by intense light, or certain spells, mainly lightweaver ones.\nNecrotic, caused by certain weapons or shadowcaster spells.\nBleeding, dealt to a creature at the beginning of its turns until it is stopped.\nSunder, caused to objects. Yes, each object has its own Vitality and may as well break.\n\n\n\nDamage & Armor\nArmor represents how hard it is to land a solid, damaging blow on a creature. It’s the damage reduction applied on each individual attack. Armor is calculated as the sum of the creature’s the individual armor parts. Some races also receive a natural armor bonus.\n\n\nAbility Contests\nSome attacks require a contest between the attacker and the defendant to succeed. These contests are by default deterministic, meaning that the creature with the highest ability score succeeds (ties benefit the defendant). These contests are denoted in parenthesis: the first ability concerns the attacker, and the second the defendant. For example: (strength vs dexterity) or (willpower vs willpower). In many cases, the defendant gets to choose between two ability scores, e.g. (strength vs strength/dexterity). If the attack fails, the special effect (e.g. slowed or enraged) fails as well; all other damage is calculated as normal.\n\n\nTurn Example\nRon the human butcher is chasing Grin the goblin for throwing his cat into the stew. The two characters are 14m apart. Ron yields a shovel and a kitchen knife. Grin wears some scraps as armor. The stats of the two creatures are the following: Ron (level 7): 40 vitality, 20 sanity, 4 strength, 3 dexterity, 2 intelligence, 2 willpower. Grin (level 3): 30 vitality, 10 sanity, 1 strength, 4 dexterity, 3 intelligence, 1 willpower.\n\nBoth creatures roll d10 for initiative. Ron (8 roll + 3 dex) = 11, Grin (4 roll + 4 dex) = 8.\nRon starts his turn. He has 4 str, 3 dex, 2 int, 2 will available, plus the 10m of movement.\nRon moves 10m and utilizes 2 dex to move another 4m and be in touch range of Grin.\nRon performs a finesse attack with the dagger (1 dex), enhanced by a fire orb spell (1 int).\nRon rolls the damage (6 dagger + 3 fire orb) = 9.\nGrin has an armor of 1 (scraps), therefore takes (9 – 1) = 8 points of damage. He now has (30 - 8) = 22 vitality points.\nRon deals a shovel attack (1 str), enhanced by power attack (1 str) and overpower (1 str).\nGrin uses the cat reflexes reaction (1 dex) enhanced by evade (2 dex) to move to an adjacent square. At this point, Ron still has 1 str, 1 int and 2 will to utilize in his turn. At the end of his turn, all of his ability points will be replenished and ready to use again.Grin has used a reaction (a total of 3 dex points), meaning that in his turn he will only have (4 - 3) = 1 dex point available to utilize.",

    "text": "Introduction\nDexterity measures a creature’s agility, reflexes, and speed. This ability plays a pivotal role for adventurers seeking to slip unnoticed through the shadows or gracefully traverse treacherous rooftops.\n\n\nTalents\nAn ability point assigned to strength, dexterity, intelligence, or willpower grants a new combat talent to the creature. Dexterity-based talents are called maneuvers. A creature knows a number of maneuvers equal to its dexterity score.\nThe tier of a talent cannot surpass the corresponding ability score of the creature. For example, a creature with a strength score of 4 cannot learn a 5th-tier feat (since it would not be able to use it).\n\n\nDefenses\nIn contrast to many RPG games, dexterity is not added to the armor bonus by default. This is a maneuver that needs to be activated.\n\n\nLosing Dexterity\nA creature’s grace and agility, epitomized by their Dexterity score, can dramatically impact their ability to undertake mundane tasks. As this score plummets below zero, a dismal state of clumsiness befalls the unfortunate being, hindering their very existence.\nIndicative Effects:\n\n0: The creature is prone to occasional trips.\n-1: The creature is clumsy.\n-2: Visible paralysis hampers the creature’s movement.\n-3: Even the most basic actions require great effort.\n-4: The creature is significantly paralyzed.\n-5: The creature is incapacitated (see conditions).",

    "text": "Introduction\nSanity measures mental stability and fortitude. In the mysterious and perilous realms, adventurers must not only face physical threats but also the daunting challenges that test the limits of their sanity. Just as Vitality guards against the harsh blows of physical combat, Sanity safeguards against the relentless onslaught of mental exhaustion.\nAs characters delve into the depths of ancient ruins, confront eldritch horrors, and unravel dark secrets, their sanity will be tested, and the consequences of losing these precious points could be dire. Hallucinations, paranoia, and a fog of anxiety are just a few of the harrowing effects that may befall those who venture too close to the abyss of their own minds. Prepare yourselves, for in this extraordinary journey, the greatest challenges may not lurk in the shadows but lie within the fragile sanctuary of your sanity.\n\n\nPersonality and Mental Conditions\nThe five mental conditions (anger, sorrow, confusion, fear, and charm) cause mental distress to a creature. Every character has a personality chart modeling five traits that each counters one condition (calm, mirthful, inquisitive, courageous, and cautious). Characters have 12 points to distribute in these traits, 0-5 points to each one. Upon receiving a condition, the character loses 5 sanity points, reduced by the number of points allocated to the corresponding personality trait. For example, a creature with a score of 2 in calm only takes 3 points of sanity damage from the anger condition.\nSome races impose restrictions on the point allocation. Magic items and enchanted jewelry can grant extra personality points.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSleep Deprivation\nA creature can choose to stay awake for several additional hours beyond its normal waking hours (16 for most characters). For each day that a creature does not get a full 8-hour rest, it takes 5 points of sanity damage. When it comes to restoring sanity, there is nothing like a good night’s sleep. A creature restores 20 sanity points, up to its total maximum, each day it gets a full rest. Profession-wise, entertainers have the unique ability to restore sanity using their performance.\n\n\nLosing Sanity\nAs characters lose their sanity, madness starts to kick in. Delirium, hallucinations, amnesia, catatonia, psychosomatic loss, or schizophrenia. All of these conditions are tasty nourishment for the terrors known as toons, which will hunt and haunt down relentlessly any creature that has a low sanity score. If a creature’s sanity reaches 0, expect a swarm of toons to appear.",

    "text": "Introduction\nVitality measures health and stamina. A creature loses vitality from attacks, starvation, or diseases. As a character’s vitality points decrease, they become more vulnerable and may experience negative effects. Maintaining high vitality is crucial for characters in order to increase their chances of success and survival in the world.\n\n\nLevel up\nIf the ability point of a level up is invested in vitality, the character gains an extra 10 vitality points.\nNote: Playable characters can only have a max vitality score that is a multiple of 10. Other creatures and beasts do not need to follow this rule.\n\n\nFood and Starvation\nMost creatures need to eat daily to maintain their health and stamina. Creatures that do not receive the required amount of food and water each day take 5 points of vitality damage. On the other hand, a full day’s meal can restore 20 points of vitality, up to the total maximum.\n\n\nLosing Consciousness\nIf a creature’s vitality reaches 0, it immediately loses consciousness and becomes incapacitated (See Conditions). To regain consciousness, the creature needs to somehow regain at least 1 vitality point. Healing can be achieved in the following ways:\n\nThe creature rests for 8 hours to regain 1d10 vitality points.\nThe creature is nursed back to health by first aid or by a healing potion (see the physician profession).\nThe creature receives a blessing. This can only take effect once per day.\n\n\n\nDeath\nIf an incapacitated creature that has 0 vitality points receives another hit, it is considered a death blow, or “coup de grace”.\n\n\nTemporary Vitality Points\nTemporary vitality points can provide a shield for a limited period of time. The points are added to the current total and are the first ones to be lost if the creature receives damage. When the effect that granted the points ends, any excess temporary points that have not been used to absorb damage disappear, and the creature’s vitality returns to its actual total. Temporary vitality points do not stack.\nLosing vitality is an easy task; all you need to do is tell your dwarven friends their ale stinks.",

For each level, characters gain one additional ability point to an ability of their choice.\n\n\nDistribute your ability points\nEach character has six ability scores that represent their most basic attributes, their dominant aspects, and the way they interact with their environment. The ability points are determined by the race and the level.\n\n\nPick your talents\nIn combat, you can utilize your abilities to perform extraordinary feats (Strength-based talents), maneuvers (Dexterity-based talents), spells (Intelligence-based talents), or evocations (Willpower-based talents). For each ability point, your character learns 1 talent of the associated ability.\n\n\nPick your professions\nCharacters can be skilled in many arts and crafts. As they traverse the lands they become more effective at tasks that require specialized knowledge or training. Profession points are equal to the character’s intelligence score, plus any racial bonuses that they might receive.\n\n\nLeadership\nSocial skills and relationships take the form of Leadership points, which can be used to unlock boons, divine interventions that might make the difference in a moment of despair. Your character has a number of leadership points equal to their Willpower score, plus any racial bonuses that they might receive.\n\n\nChoose equipment\nNow that your character is ready, you need to dress them up! Choose weapons, armor, gems, or herbs that they might carry with them. Each character receives an initial kit associated with their professions.\n\n\nBackstory time\nAlong the process of creating your character, you surely came up with a few ideas about their past, their present, and their future. Think of the town where your character was born and raised, the friends they made in their journeys, or the deity they pray to.\n\n\nLevel up\nCharacters start from commoners and street folk and may advance up to living legends that bards sing about. At the end of every adventure, characters find themselves more experienced. This experience is translated into ability points and skills according to their deeds. The level-up is fairly straightforward: Each time characters level up, they gain 1 ability point to an ability of their choice. They also learn 1 talent of the corresponding ability. If this point is put on Intelligence or Willpower, the profession or leadership points increase, respectively.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "Origins\nIn the vast and ancient realm of Terra, one can find a unique and enigmatic race known as Dwarves. These beings are unlike any other inhabitants of this mystical world, for they are not merely born into existence as others are, but rather, they are the very offspring of Terra itself. In stark contrast to the societies of Elves or the familiar human families, Dwarves know not the concept of gender. They exist as a singular, undivided people, sculpted by the hand of their ancestors, unburdened by the intricate complexities of human reproduction.\nWhile they do not require sustenance, Dwarves occasionally indulge in the consumption of food and ale, though their culinary preferences lean towards the unadorned and the robust - roots, wafers, and hearty ales. They retire to rest for a duration of eight hours, much like their human counterparts, yet once slumber claims a Dwarf, they are said to sleep as soundly as the rocks that surround them. Attempting to rouse a sleeping Dwarf is not for the faint of heart, for it often requires a measure of force, and be forewarned, they respond to such disturbances with a vigorous retaliation.\nIn the realm of Dwarvenkin, there exists a diminutive race known as gnomes, often referred to as “hill” dwarves. Gnomes are crafted from soil, a remarkable feature that grants them a distinctive blend of characteristics. They are softer than the stony dwarves of Lethenie, yet sturdier than the flesh and blood of humans.\n\n\nPhysical Form\nThese enigmatic beings stand at a height of approximately 0.8 to 1 meter and possess a unique composition that sets them apart from both their dwarven and human counterparts. Some whisper that gnomes can live for a hundred years, while others believe they might extend their existence for a thousand. However, gnomes take great delight in shrouding this aspect of their lives in secrecy, preferring to keep the world guessing.\n\n\nSociety\nIn a world where tradition and isolationism often define dwarven society, gnomes are the renegades of their kin. While their dwarf brethren dwell deep within the earth or secluded mountain fortresses, gnomes choose a different path. They embrace the human world, living in villages and small towns alongside their larger neighbors. Such a choice is regarded as anathema by most dwarves, who view it as a betrayal of their heritage. Yet, gnomes have their reasons, for they possess an insatiable thirst for knowledge. Gnomes are relentless seekers of wisdom, ever on a quest to expand their understanding of the world. They can be found poring over dusty tomes in a library or listening intently to the melodies spun by traveling bards. Their adaptability to human ways is nothing short of astonishing, and they willingly follow human laws and customs. This assimilation has earned them a unique position in society, often holding prestigious roles such as counselors or artificers, serving local lords or kings.\nBut beneath their seemingly boundless curiosity and outward adaptability, gnomes carry a burden. They harbor a deep-seated sense of fragility, constantly feeling inferior to their dwarven cousins and the more numerous humans. The world has not always treated them kindly, and though they may forgive, they do not forget. To earn the friendship of a gnome requires a special touch. Manners, courtesy, and civility are paramount. Gnomes appreciate these virtues and are always eager to hear tales of adventures from distant and mysterious lands.\n\n\nCombat Style\nIn the realm of arms and armor, gnomes prefer subtlety over sheer brute force. They are skilled with a variety of weapons such as daggers, canes, short swords, sickles, picks, or any tools that can be wielded with precision. Armor, however, is another matter entirely. Gnomes shy away from heavy protection, instead favoring something lighter yet elegant. Good quality leather is their preferred choice, offering both freedom of movement and a touch of finesse.

    "text": "Origins\nIn the vast and ancient realm of Terra, one can find a unique and enigmatic race known as Dwarves. These beings are unlike any other inhabitants of this mystical world, for they are not merely born into existence as others are, but rather, they are the very offspring of Terra itself. In stark contrast to the societies of Elves or the familiar human families, Dwarves know not the concept of gender. They exist as a singular, undivided people, sculpted by the hand of their ancestors, unburdened by the intricate complexities of human reproduction.\nWhile they do not require sustenance, Dwarves occasionally indulge in the consumption of food and ale, though their culinary preferences lean towards the unadorned and the robust - roots, wafers, and hearty ales. They retire to rest for a duration of eight hours, much like their human counterparts, yet once slumber claims a Dwarf, they are said to sleep as soundly as the rocks that surround them. Attempting to rouse a sleeping Dwarf is not for the faint of heart, for it often requires a measure of force, and be forewarned, they respond to such disturbances with a vigorous retaliation.\nDeep within the subterranean heart of the Paterna mountains, the Lethenie or Lethenae, also known as the “mine” Dwarves, hold sway as the eldest and most resilient of their kin. Their existence unfolds beneath the surface of Terra, in a vast labyrinth of tunnels and dungeons that stretch like a complex web through the very bones of the earth itself.\n\n\nPhysical Form\nPhysically, Lethenie stand as medium-sized creatures, their statures ranging from 1 to 1.3 meters, and their robust frames weighing more than 120 kilograms. Their longevity varies greatly depending on their caste, with lifespans ranging from 200 to 500 years.\n\n\nSociety\nLethenie society is an intricate tapestry of castes, each defined by the precious metal from which its members were sculpted and the metals they tirelessly unearth from the depths. These hierarchical divisions determine not only one’s social status but also their access to resources and power. It is a world where the very metal that forms their bodies and tools also molds their destinies.\nThese stout beings bear the weight of their ages with a natural grumpiness and a deep-seated xenophobia. Suspicion and distrust greet anyone not of their kind, whether hailing from a distant realm or even from within their own ranks. Only one exception may soften their stance - human merchants bearing the jingle of coinage in their pockets. The allure of profit can occasionally pierce the armor of their prejudice.\nYet, it is not only the intricacies of their society that define Lethenie. Their collective soul burns with an intense and unrelenting hatred for the reptants and, above all, the menacing dragons. These ancient, winged creatures are viewed as abominations, their very existence an affront to the sanctity of Terra.\n\n\nCombat Style\nWhen it comes to their tools and weapons, Lethenie adhere to a strict creed. Axes, picks, pickaxes, hammers, maces, and crossbows are the instruments of their trade, and anything outside this arsenal is regarded as peculiar and heretical. They drape themselves in all forms of armor, the heavier, the better, for their underground realms are as unforgiving as their hearts. These resolute mine Dwarves stand as a testament to the enduring strength of Terra and its indomitable children, unyielding in their quest for precious ores and undeterred by the darkness that surrounds them.\n\n\nStats\nLethenae begin with the following ability points at level 0:\n\n30 Vitality\n20 Sanity\n+2 Strength\n+0 Dexterity\n+2 Intelligence\n+1 Willpower\n\n\n\nSpecial Abilities\nSubterrans: Lethenie have resistance against the earth element and are immune to poison.\nTremorsense: Even though Lethenie have poor eyesight, they can sense the vibrations of the ground in mid-range. They lose this ability in muddy grounds and swamps, or if they get wet.\nCastes: The mineral substance of a Dwarf determines their special bond with Μother Terra:\n\nDiamond: Resistance to piercing.\nSapphire: Forge magical water weapons.\nRuby: Forge magical fire weapons.\nAmber: Forge magical electric weapons.\nEmerald: Forge magical earth weapons.\nTitanium: Resistance to bludgeoning.\nGold: Goldsense in close range.\nSilver: Immunity to the charmed condition.\nMercury: Toxic on contact, except to iron.\nObsidian: Bleeding shatters upon hit.\nCopper: Immunity to all diseases.\nLead: Poisonous shatters upon hit.\nIron: Resistance to slashing.\nSulfur: Emit a scent that repels beasts.\nCoal: Emit an ash cloud for 1 minute.",

    "text": "Greenkin\nIn the sprawling expanse of the realms, the Green Kin stands as a formidable and unique family. Within this eclectic lineage, one finds Orcs, Trolls, and their pint-sized counterparts, the Goblins. Though they share a common ancestry with the graceful and ethereal Fey, their existence paints a canvas distinct from that of their Elven kin. These beings possess a peculiar nature that sets them apart, characterized by a constant tension with other races and, more often than not, even among themselves. The origins of the Green Kin trace back to the ancient Fey, who were born from the heart of magnificent trees, imbued with the essence of nature itself. Over time, however, the line diverged, and these descendants adopted an entirely different path. Unlike their Elven cousins, who embraced harmony with the land, the Green Folk have come to be known for their unruly and often chaotic existence. One of the most striking aspects of the Green Kin’s way of life is their unrefined and primal behavior. They eat and sleep much like humans, yet with notable deviations. Their culinary preferences lean heavily toward raw meat, relishing in the visceral thrill of tearing into freshly hunted prey. Cooking is a rare endeavor for them, a practice only indulged in on the rarest of occasions. The scent of searing meat over a campfire is foreign to their senses, as they prefer the raw, unadulterated essence of their prey. Observing the Green Kin in their daily routines can be an unsettling experience for those unfamiliar with their ways. Each of the three races within the family exhibits a profound connection to their primal instincts. Orcs, with their robust physiques and powerful frames, are often likened to savage warriors. Trolls, towering and hulking, display a near-insatiable appetite for destruction and chaos. Goblins, though diminutive in stature, possess an innate cunning and mischievousness that makes them both dangerous and unpredictable. Conflict simmers beneath the surface of the Green Kin’s interactions, both with outsiders and among themselves. Their society is a volatile mixture of rivalries, territorial disputes, and power struggles, where alliances are fleeting and betrayal is commonplace. It is a world where might makes right, and survival is a constant struggle. Despite their savage tendencies and propensity for discord, the Green Kin are a vital part of the fantasy world’s rich tapestry. Their presence adds depth and complexity to the realms they inhabit, as they navigate the fine line between their primal origins and the evolving world around them, forever bound to the green and untamed heart of their ancestry. Orcs Orcs emerge as formidable and enigmatic beings, their existence shrouded in the bleak shadows of forsaken lands. They are creatures deeply tied to the untamed wilderness, fiercely guarding their territories from all intruders, especially the Toons who dare approach their revered mother tree. Standing imposingly at heights ranging from 2 to 2.5 meters and weighing over 150 kilograms, Orcs are a force to be reckoned with. Within the Orcish society, two distinct categories emerge: the tribal Orcs of the Swamps and the nomadic Orcs of Erämaa. These two factions, despite their differences, share a common ferocity and determination, embodying the essence of the Orcish spirit. It is a somber truth that Orcs are often met with distrust and fear from most other races. Amongst Humans, they are frequently ostracized, forced to navigate the lowest echelons of society, their potential unrealized. For Elves, Orcs are perceived as a blight, a creeping disease that withers the very nature around them, and as such, Elves rarely tolerate their presence. Even the most fearsome of Fey beasts harbor a natural hostility toward Orcs, with the exception of the children of Felis and Ha’até, who inexplicably extend their rarest of welcomes. In the realm of combat, Orcs are renowned for their affinity for great, two-handed weapons, with a distinct preference for massive axes that can cleave through foes with brutal efficiency. Occasionally, they wield formidable swords, showcasing their versatility in battle. Yet, Orcs are no strangers to ranged combat, always carrying heavy spears for throwing, ensuring that no enemy remains beyond their reach. Their choice of attire often leans towards practicality, with a preference for leather armor over the cumbersome metallic alternatives. This adaptability allows Orcs to move with agility and strike with precision, making them a truly relentless force on the battlefield. Stats Orcs begin with the following ability points at level 0:  30 Vitality  +4 Strength  +0 Dexterity  20 Sanity  +0 Intelligence  +3 Willpower Special Abilities Spiritvision: Orcs can see all spirits around them. This causes blindness when they are around a large number of souls, particularly humans.\nNatural Armor: Orcs have particularly hard skin, gaining a +2 Armor bonus. Fearless: Orcs are immune to all fear effects. Nethergrasp: Orcs can grasp spirits and ethereal beings as if they had physical substance. They can attack toons with their bare hands and have resistance against spirit damage. Tribes: Orcs belong to one of two tribes:  Swamp Orcs: There is no better home for Toons than the marshlands, vast lands that the sun can hardly reach. Some say that those swamps remind them of their very own realm. Swamp Orcs live in tribes deep inside the marshlands. They are born from Salix trees, which grow in muddy waters. Legends say these Orcs can live for up to a millennium; most of them die in battle far earlier than that though.  Desert Orcs: Sand keeps its secrets well. In its hidden catacombs Toons lurk until the sun goes out. The nomadic Orcs of Erämaa and Percia are always on the Hunt. They are born from Acacia trees. The Desert Orcs have a lifespan of 200 years. Trolls In the dark corners of the world where the shadows grow long and the land turns unforgiving, there dwell the Trolls. These formidable creatures are the embodiment of wrath, their existence marred by violence and bloodshed. Trolls, shunned by the world’s other races, live on the fringes, engulfed in their own anger. Trolls come in two distinct breeds, each unique in their own right. First, there are the Trolls of the Swamps, solitary giants who navigate the murky waters of their isolated homes. Second, the tribal Trolls of the Jungle, who band together in fearsome clans, united by their shared rage. Both breeds share a common feature; a burning, uncontrollable anger that defines their very essence. Standing at a towering 3 to 4 meters in height and weighing a staggering 250 kilograms, Trolls are imposing figures on the landscape. Their lifespans remain a mystery, primarily because they are more likely to meet their end at the hands of their own kind rather than succumb to natural causes. Trolls are not creatures that find acceptance among other races. Humans, often quick to judge, attack Trolls on sight, labeling them as mindless monsters. Dwarves, with their pragmatic view of the world, consider Trolls irrelevant and steer clear of them. Elves, known for their grace and beauty, find Trolls nothing short of repulsive, their appearance and behavior a stark contrast to Elvish ideals. Trolls are not known for their finesse or craftsmanship; instead, they wield large clubs or logs, primarily as weapons but also as excellent back scratchers. They rarely adorn themselves with armor, but when they do, it’s often the hide of their victims, potentially even those of their human prey. Stats Trolls begin with the following ability points at level 0:  40 Vitality  +5 Strength  +0 Dexterity  20 Sanity  +0 Intelligence  +1 Willpower Special Abilities Regeneration: Trolls have regenerative abilities, healing 5 life points per round. Trolls wounded for more than half their life points have their regeneration lowered to 1 life point per round. Fire suppresses regeneration for one round. Natural Armor: Trolls have particularly hard skin, gaining a +2 Armor bonus. Swamp Trolls: Trolls that live in the swamps lead solitary lives. They are born from Ash trees, which grow in muddy waters. Their lifespan is 350 years. Swamp Trolls are filthy and cannot hide the intense smell of fungi that covers them. They get:  Marsh Strider: They can walk in muddy waters without any problem.  Light Sensitivity: They are blinded by intense light.  Poisonous Skin: Creatures that touch them risk being poisoned.\nJungle Trolls: Jungle Trolls live in tribes. They are born from kapok trees and have a lifespan of 60 years. They are territorial and have short tempers. Jungle Trolls get:  Member of the Tribe: They get a +3 Talisman bonus when in groups.  Animal Senses: They get a +5 Perception bonus. Goblins In a shadowy world, Goblins are renowned for their cunning and devious nature. These mischievous creatures possess a knack for acquiring things without spending a single coin, believing that if you can steal it, why waste hard-earned treasure? This philosophy defines their way of life, though it often leads to them being hunted down mercilessly by Humans who view them with deep-seated distrust and fear, resorting to violence at the mere sight of a Goblin. Goblins stand diminutively, reaching a modest height of 50 to 80 centimeters and weighing around 20 kilograms. Their short stature allows them to navigate hidden nooks and crannies with ease, perfect for their thieving endeavors. Unfortunately, their small size also shortens their lifespan, with most Goblins living only 30 years. These crafty beings seldom operate alone, preferring to band together in tight-knit gangs ranging from 5 to 20 individuals. Within these groups, two key figures emerge as leaders: the Chieftain and the Shaman. The Chieftain is typically the tallest Goblin in the gang, chosen for their imposing stature and natural leadership skills. They play a vital role in decision-making and representing the gang’s interests. The Shaman, on the other hand, possesses a unique and coveted talent – the ability to create fire. This extraordinary power sets them apart, earning both respect and fear from their fellow Goblins. Shamans are known to live significantly longer than their peers, with some reaching the ripe age of 50 years. Their mastery of fire-making is essential for survival, aiding in cooking stolen food and providing warmth during the chill of night. When it comes to their habitats, Goblins prefer to make their homes in the most unlikely of places – abandoned neighborhoods and slums. These forgotten corners of the world offer them refuge from prying eyes and often supply a plethora of hidden treasures to pilfer. As resourceful beings, Goblins fashion their weapons from scrap materials scavenged during their nocturnal forays. Small blades and slings are their preferred tools of the trade, ideal for quick and silent strikes. Their ingenuity extends to their choice of armor, favoring the durability and affordability of leather. Interestingly, Goblins have a particular fondness for smelly leather, believing that the stench adds an intimidating aura to their presence. Stats Goblins begin with the following ability points at level 0:  10 Vitality  +1 Strength  +4 Dexterity  20 Sanity  +3 Intelligence  +1 Willpower Special Abilities Filthy yet Healthy: Goblins have immunity against nauseating effects. Born Acrobats: Even though they are small, goblins are extremely dexterous. They can walk on narrow surfaces without a problem and jump 2m high. Sticky Fingers: Goblins can’t resist a shiny trinket. They get a +3 Stealth bonus. Talented: Goblins practice many different arts. They gain +2 Profession points, one of them in the Engineer profession. Ankle Biter: When attacked bare-handed Goblins, as a reaction, bite down on the offending limb, giving them 2d4 piercing damage.",

Blending human essence with mechanical marvels, these beings exist as a synthesis of flesh and metal.\n\n\nPhysical Form\nThough their intelligence remains on par with their human origins, their physical forms can vary vastly from their purely organic counterparts. Each cyborg bears a unique appearance, reflecting the intricate craftsmanship of self-modification or the expertise of skilled artificers who have shaped their beings. The cyborgs stand as a testament to the boundless possibilities of melding man and machine. Their lifespan is no longer confined to the limitations of mere mortals. The durability of their engineered components determines the length of their existence, ranging from relatively short if poor-quality parts were employed, to potentially surpassing the human lifespan by a significant margin. The question of whether they can reach eternity, an uncharted realm of everlasting existence, looms in the realm of speculation. As they continue to push the boundaries of augmentation and advancement, the potential for an existence beyond the confines of time becomes an intriguing possibility.\n\n\nSociety\nWithin the bustling cities where the cyborgs dwell, they are both revered and misunderstood. Their existence serves as a testament to the ingenuity and advancements of society, yet their unique appearances can cause unease among those unaccustomed to their sight. The cyborgs, ever-evolving and forging their own path in a world of endless possibilities, do not worry themselves with the opinions of conservative, mortal beings. They challenge the very definition of what it means to be alive, blurring the lines between biological and mechanical, and leaving an indelible mark on the annals of civilization.\n\n\nCombat Style\nIn matters of combat, cyborgs possess a formidable prowess, particularly when wielding heavy weapons. The strength and endurance granted by their mechanical augmentations allow them to unleash devastating force, wielding massive arms of destruction with relative ease. Finesse weapons, however, may prove less suited to their enhanced forms, as their focus lies in raw power rather than delicate precision. Their hard exterior shell serves as a protective layer, rendering the need for additional armor somewhat unnecessary. Crafted from resilient alloys and advanced materials, their shells provide a level of defense that surpasses conventional armors.
