title: "Dexterity"
---

### Introduction

Dexterity measures a creature's agility, reflexes, and speed. This ability plays a pivotal role for adventurers seeking to slip unnoticed through the shadows or gracefully traverse treacherous rooftops.

### Talents

An ability point assigned to strength, dexterity, intelligence, or willpower grants a new combat talent to the creature. Dexterity-based talents are called maneuvers. A creature knows a number of maneuvers equal to its dexterity score. 

The tier of a talent cannot surpass the corresponding ability score of the creature. For example, a creature with a strength score of 4 cannot learn a 5th-tier feat (since it would not be able to use it).

### Defenses

In contrast to many RPG games, dexterity is not added to the armor bonus by default. This is a maneuver that needs to be activated.

### Losing Dexterity

A creature's grace and agility, epitomized by their Dexterity score, can dramatically impact their ability to undertake mundane tasks. As this score plummets below zero, a dismal state of clumsiness befalls the unfortunate being, hindering their very existence. 

Indicative Effects:

- 0: The creature is prone to occasional trips.
- -1: The creature is clumsy.
- -2: Visible paralysis hampers the creature's movement. 
- -3: Even the most basic actions require great effort. 
- -4: The creature is significantly paralyzed.
- -5: The creature is incapacitated (see conditions).
