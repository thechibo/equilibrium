title: "Intelligence"
---

### Introduction

Intelligence measures a creature's mental acuity and deduction skills. It is an important skill for characters that want to solve mysteries and get all the answers to their questions.

### Talents

An ability point assigned to strength, dexterity, intelligence, or willpower grants a new combat talent to the creature. Intelligence-based talents are called spells. A creature knows a number of spells equal to its intelligence score. 

The tier of a talent cannot surpass the corresponding ability score of the creature. For example, a creature with a strength score of 4 cannot learn a 5th-tier feat (since it would not be able to use it).

### Professions

Characters can be skilled in many arts and crafts. Intelligence is added to profession points, making characters more effective at tasks that require specialized knowledge or training. Your character has a number of profession points equal to their intelligence score, plus any racial bonuses that they might receive. 

### Losing Intelligence

The essence of a creature's intellectual prowess lies encapsulated in their intelligence score, a beacon guiding their ability to comprehend and process information. Yet, should this score wane below zero, a shroud of cognitive dysfunction enshrouds the unfortunate being, rendering them incapable of navigating the intricacies of thought. 

Indicative Effects:

- 0: The creature struggles to follow trains of thoughts.
- -1: The creature misuses words.
- -2: The creature seemingly lacks common sense. 
- -3: The creature is oblivious to the presence of items or people around them. 
- -4: The creature appears bereft of thought.
- -5: The creature is confused (see conditions).
