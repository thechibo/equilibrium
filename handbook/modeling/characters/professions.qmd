Characters can be skilled in many arts and crafts. As they traverse the lands they become more effective at tasks that require specialized knowledge or training.

Profession points are equal to the character's intelligence score, plus any racial bonuses that they might receive. Every profession comes with a default kit, including the essential tools for the job. 

Each profession has 10 tiers. By advancing in the tier ladder, characters learn to craft more intricate items, or gain knowledge that is scarce within the realms.
