#### Origins



#### Physical Form

In physical form, Humans stand at a moderate stature, their frames reaching heights of 1.6 to 1.8 meters, while their weight ranges between 60 and 100 kilograms.

#### Society

While some among them possess wisdom and enlightenment, many others remain untouched by the pursuit of deeper understanding.
