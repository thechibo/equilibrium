Greenkin

In the sprawling expanse of the realms, the Green Kin stands as a formidable and unique family. Within this eclectic lineage, one finds Orcs, Trolls, and their pint-sized counterparts, the Goblins. Though they share a common ancestry with the graceful and ethereal Fey, their existence paints a canvas distinct from that of their Elven kin. These beings possess a peculiar nature that sets them apart, characterized by a constant tension with other races and, more often than not, even among themselves. The origins of the Green Kin trace back to the ancient Fey, who were born from the heart of magnificent trees, imbued with the essence of nature itself. Over time, however, the line diverged, and these descendants adopted an entirely different path. Unlike their Elven cousins, who embraced harmony with the land, the Green Folk have come to be known for their unruly and often chaotic existence. One of the most striking aspects of the Green Kin's way of life is their unrefined and primal behavior. They eat and sleep much like humans, yet with notable deviations. Their culinary preferences lean heavily toward raw meat, relishing in the visceral thrill of tearing into freshly hunted prey. Cooking is a rare endeavor for them, a practice only indulged in on the rarest of occasions. The scent of searing meat over a campfire is foreign to their senses, as they prefer the raw, unadulterated essence of their prey. Observing the Green Kin in their daily routines can be an unsettling experience for those unfamiliar with their ways. Each of the three races within the family exhibits a profound connection to their primal instincts. Orcs, with their robust physiques and powerful frames, are often likened to savage warriors. Trolls, towering and hulking, display a near-insatiable appetite for destruction and chaos. Goblins, though diminutive in stature, possess an innate cunning and mischievousness that makes them both dangerous and unpredictable. Conflict simmers beneath the surface of the Green Kin's interactions, both with outsiders and among themselves. Their society is a volatile mixture of rivalries, territorial disputes, and power struggles, where alliances are fleeting and betrayal is commonplace. It is a world where might makes right, and survival is a constant struggle. Despite their savage tendencies and propensity for discord, the Green Kin are a vital part of the fantasy world's rich tapestry. Their presence adds depth and complexity to the realms they inhabit, as they navigate the fine line between their primal origins and the evolving world around them, forever bound to the green and untamed heart of their ancestry. Orcs Orcs emerge as formidable and enigmatic beings, their existence shrouded in the bleak shadows of forsaken lands. They are creatures deeply tied to the untamed wilderness, fiercely guarding their territories from all intruders, especially the Toons who dare approach their revered mother tree. Standing imposingly at heights ranging from 2 to 2.5 meters and weighing over 150 kilograms, Orcs are a force to be reckoned with. Within the Orcish society, two distinct categories emerge: the tribal Orcs of the Swamps and the nomadic Orcs of Erämaa. These two factions, despite their differences, share a common ferocity and determination, embodying the essence of the Orcish spirit. It is a somber truth that Orcs are often met with distrust and fear from most other races. Amongst Humans, they are frequently ostracized, forced to navigate the lowest echelons of society, their potential unrealized. For Elves, Orcs are perceived as a blight, a creeping disease that withers the very nature around them, and as such, Elves rarely tolerate their presence. Even the most fearsome of Fey beasts harbor a natural hostility toward Orcs, with the exception of the children of Felis and Ha'até, who inexplicably extend their rarest of welcomes. In the realm of combat, Orcs are renowned for their affinity for great, two-handed weapons, with a distinct preference for massive axes that can cleave through foes with brutal efficiency. Occasionally, they wield formidable swords, showcasing their versatility in battle. Yet, Orcs are no strangers to ranged combat, always carrying heavy spears for throwing, ensuring that no enemy remains beyond their reach. Their choice of attire often leans towards practicality, with a preference for leather armor over the cumbersome metallic alternatives. This adaptability allows Orcs to move with agility and strike with precision, making them a truly relentless force on the battlefield. Stats Orcs begin with the following ability points at level 0:  30 Vitality  +4 Strength  +0 Dexterity  20 Sanity  +0 Intelligence  +3 Willpower Special Abilities Spiritvision: Orcs can see all spirits around them.

Nethergrasp: Orcs can grasp spirits and ethereal beings as if they had physical substance. They can attack toons with their bare hands and have resistance against spirit damage. Tribes: Orcs belong to one of two tribes:  Swamp Orcs: There is no better home for Toons than the marshlands, vast lands that the sun can hardly reach. Some say that those swamps remind them of their very own realm. Swamp Orcs live in tribes deep inside the marshlands. They are born from Salix trees, which grow in muddy waters. Legends say these Orcs can live for up to a millennium; most of them die in battle far earlier than that though.  Desert Orcs: Sand keeps its secrets well. In its hidden catacombs Toons lurk until the sun goes out. The nomadic Orcs of Erämaa and Percia are always on the Hunt. They are born from Acacia trees. The Desert Orcs have a lifespan of 200 years. Trolls In the dark corners of the world where the shadows grow long and the land turns unforgiving, there dwell the Trolls. These formidable creatures are the embodiment of wrath, their existence marred by violence and bloodshed. Trolls, shunned by the world's other races, live on the fringes, engulfed in their own anger. Trolls come in two distinct breeds, each unique in their own right. First, there are the Trolls of the Swamps, solitary giants who navigate the murky waters of their isolated homes. Second, the tribal Trolls of the Jungle, who band together in fearsome clans, united by their shared rage. Both breeds share a common feature; a burning, uncontrollable anger that defines their very essence. Standing at a towering 3 to 4 meters in height and weighing a staggering 250 kilograms, Trolls are imposing figures on the landscape. Their lifespans remain a mystery, primarily because they are more likely to meet their end at the hands of their own kind rather than succumb to natural causes. Trolls are not creatures that find acceptance among other races. Humans, often quick to judge, attack Trolls on sight, labeling them as mindless monsters. Dwarves, with their pragmatic view of the world, consider Trolls irrelevant and steer clear of them. Elves, known for their grace and beauty, find Trolls nothing short of repulsive, their appearance and behavior a stark contrast to Elvish ideals. Trolls are not known for their finesse or craftsmanship; instead, they wield large clubs or logs, primarily as weapons but also as excellent back scratchers. They rarely adorn themselves with armor, but when they do, it's often the hide of their victims, potentially even those of their human prey.

Goblins In a shadowy world, Goblins are renowned for their cunning and devious nature. These mischievous creatures possess a knack for acquiring things without spending a single coin, believing that if you can steal it, why waste hard-earned treasure? This philosophy defines their way of life, though it often leads to them being hunted down mercilessly by Humans who view them with deep-seated distrust and fear, resorting to violence at the mere sight of a Goblin. Goblins stand diminutively, reaching a modest height of 50 to 80 centimeters and weighing around 20 kilograms. Their short stature allows them to navigate hidden nooks and crannies with ease, perfect for their thieving endeavors. Unfortunately, their small size also shortens their lifespan, with most Goblins living only 30 years. These crafty beings seldom operate alone, preferring to band together in tight-knit gangs ranging from 5 to 20 individuals. Within these groups, two key figures emerge as leaders: the Chieftain and the Shaman. The Chieftain is typically the tallest Goblin in the gang, chosen for their imposing stature and natural leadership skills. They play a vital role in decision-making and representing the gang's interests. The Shaman, on the other hand, possesses a unique and coveted talent -- the ability to create fire. This extraordinary power sets them apart, earning both respect and fear from their fellow Goblins. Shamans are known to live significantly longer than their peers, with some reaching the ripe age of 50 years. Their mastery of fire-making is essential for survival, aiding in cooking stolen food and providing warmth during the chill of night. When it comes to their habitats, Goblins prefer to make their homes in the most unlikely of places -- abandoned neighborhoods and slums. These forgotten corners of the world offer them refuge from prying eyes and often supply a plethora of hidden treasures to pilfer. As resourceful beings, Goblins fashion their weapons from scrap materials scavenged during their nocturnal forays. Small blades and slings are their preferred tools of the trade, ideal for quick and silent strikes. Their ingenuity extends to their choice of armor, favoring the durability and affordability of leather. Interestingly, Goblins have a particular fondness for smelly leather, believing that the stench adds an intimidating aura to their presence. Stats Goblins begin with the following ability points at level 0:  10 Vitality  +1 Strength  +4 Dexterity  20 Sanity  +3 Intelligence  +1 Willpower Special Abilities Filthy yet Healthy: Goblins have immunity against nauseating effects. Born Acrobats: Even though they are small, goblins are extremely dexterous. They can walk on narrow surfaces without a problem and jump 2m high. Sticky Fingers: Goblins can't resist a shiny trinket. They get a +3 Stealth bonus. Talented: Goblins practice many different arts. They gain +2 Profession points, one of them in the Engineer profession. Ankle Biter: When attacked bare-handed Goblins, as a reaction, bite down on the offending limb, giving them 2d4 piercing damage.
