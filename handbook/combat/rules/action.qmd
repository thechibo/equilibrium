On their turn during combat or any relevant situation, each character possesses a pool of Strength, Dexterity, Intelligence, and Willpower points, directly influenced by their respective abilities. Depending on the task or action they wish to perform, players can invest these points into specific skills. Each skill has a Tier, which represents its costs.
