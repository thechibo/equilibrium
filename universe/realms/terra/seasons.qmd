In the fantastical realm of Terra, a mesmerizing astral system casts its celestial spell upon the lands below. At the center of this cosmic dance reigns the radiant and mighty Sun, fondly addressed by the denizens of this world as Loki. Surrounding Loki are three enigmatic Moons, named Ran, Jord, and Njord, each weaving its mystical influence across the planet. 

Loki, the golden orb of brilliance, becomes the focal point of the heavens, its majestic orbit defining the ebb and flow of days. Ingenious civilizations have embraced the concept of hours, skillfully partitioning the day into 24 equal segments. Yet, in the farthest reaches of Terra, there are enigmatic cultures that prefer not the burden of counting moments, opting to embrace the passage of time with an air of timeless grace. 

Ran, the Moon of tides and mysteries, traces a mesmerizing path through the firmament, its celestial journey marking the arrival and departure of the year. A year in Terra spans an enchanting 400 days, a vast cycle that echoes Ran's clockwise orbit from the northern Frostlands. Those blessed to dwell in the regions closest to this enigmatic lunar orb experience a realm of ethereal beauty and magical frost, for it is during this wondrous season, known as Winter, when the lands are adorned in glistening ice and blanketed in the softest of snowfalls. 

Jord, the Moon of tremors and upheaval, embarks on an intriguing voyage that spans four years, marking its presence with geophysical events that stir the very foundation of Terra. When Jord graces the night sky with its enigmatic glow, the land trembles beneath its cosmic influence, and the earth itself seems to voice its emotions through earthquakes that ripple across the landscape like echoes of ancient legends.

Njord, the tempestuous Moon of storms and hurricanes, boasts a mystifying orbit lasting three years. When Njord claims its rightful place amidst the skies, the elements dance with wild abandon. Mighty storms rage across the lands, and hurricanes unleash their fury upon the shores, creating a breathtaking display of elemental power that both terrifies and captivates the hearts of those who witness it.
